#CoffeQuest

This repo is the source code for a school project created by some Web Development students of K12's OHVA class of 2025.

The site is fully functional as a project made for a fake company named Quest Coffee (we flipped then name around in the repo to be funny), it is not a real coffee ording site but was made to look as close to one as possible.

The team has graduated and the site is no longer being worked on (unless something breaks unexpectidly, then one person will fix it).
